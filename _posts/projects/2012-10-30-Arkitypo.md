###Detail
It is typographic – just the briefest period of research revealed very few examples of prototyping merged with graphic design. The brief was to develop a 3D alphabet of alphabets. Each letterform is different, each in turn interprets its own alphabet. For each letter, there was extensive research, drawings, built maquettes and simple 3D visuals on computer using CAD tools, before Johnson Banks handed over the ideas to Ravensbourne’s team. There was a period of ‘virtual proofing’ where both parties examined the ideas as rendered files, and when all parties were happy, the process began of printing (which for some letters took as long as eight hours). Some of the ideas worked straight away, some needed refining. Some fell apart, some were perfect, but after about six months solid work by December last year the ‘alphabet’ was ready for the photography and eventual exhibition stage.
