# Ken Ravensbourne

A Visual Knowledge Browser for research projects at Ravensbourne UK.

## View projects

Projects can be browsed using a temporary web-interface. Keep in mind this is not the final visualization. We've setup this Jekyll-based website, so you can actually see the changes you make to project documents (including metadata).

Goto: http://ravensbourne.github.com
