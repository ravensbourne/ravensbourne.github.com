# Ken Ravensbourne

A Visual Knowledge Browser to exhibit student projects at Ravensbourne UK.

## Goals

- Guided Exploration of Student projects
- Filter by facets + search
- Details on demand
- An easy publishing workflow (add and update projects)
- Extensible


## Why?

Employing the Project Browser, users will be able to answer the following questions regarding a given set of documents:
- Which projects are done in Javascript?
- Which projects involve both Technologies, Javascript and Flash?
- The all or nothing question: “Which projects are relevant?”
