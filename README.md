# Ken Ravensbourne

A Visual Knowledge Browser to exhibit student projects at Ravensbourne UK.

## Goals

- Guided Exploration of Student projects
- Filter by facets + search term
- Details on demand
- An easy publishing workflow (add and update projects)
- Extensibility (use the same system for different types of content)

Here's a first mockup of the interfac we're about to create.

Employing the Project Browser, users will be able to answer the following questions regarding a given set of projects:

- Which projects have been done by Will Pearson?
- Which people have worked with Will on projects?
- Which projects were done by Will Pearson and Lizzie Jackson?
- Where can I find detailed information about a particular project?
- The all or nothing question: “Which projects are relevant?” based on the given filter criteria.
